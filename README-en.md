## Overview

Welcome to the Human Face Analysis project! This tool leverages cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect and analyze human faces in images or videos. Whether you're looking to detect emotions, estimate age, recognize gender, or extract facial features, this project has you covered.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Identify and analyze human emotions from facial expressions.
- **Age Estimation**: Predict the age of individuals based on their facial features.
- **Gender Recognition**: Determine the gender of individuals from their faces.
- **Facial Feature Extraction**: Extract and analyze key facial features for further insights.
